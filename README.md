## This branch

This branch shall contain only codes for testing various methods.

Files are being added rather than modified. The numbering of the file names
does *not* correlate to improved version of the files. Numbering is made to
distinguish specific things that have been tried.

* test1.py - first working code using Flask web framework, output to HTML table
* test2.py - methods for parsing JSON data, output as JSON literal and JSON string
* test2-N.py - demonstrate each methods in separate files for parsing JSON data
* test3.py - request to Popit API, get membership details, output as JSON literal
* test3-N.py - demonstrate add new entry to parsing, output as JSON literal
* test4.py - read JSON data, save/read using SQLite database, output as JSON literal
* test4-N.py - use JSON data from file/API, output as JSON literal
* test5.py - similar to test4.py, except using MongoDB instead of SQLite

## Actual codes

For development purpose, create a new branch i.e. devel to work on actual codes.
