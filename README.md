## This branch

This branch shall contain only codes for testing various methods.

Files are being added rather than modified. The numbering of the file names
does *not* correlate to improved version of the files. Numbering is made to
distinguish specific things that have been tried.

* test1.py - first working code using Flask web framework, output to HTML table
* test2.py - methods for parsing JSON data, output as JSON literal and JSON string
* test2-N.py - demonstrate each methods in separate files for parsing JSON data

## Actual codes

For development purpose, create a new branch i.e. devel to work on actual codes.
