Joined Up Data transparency project for PEPs, OCDS &amp; Beneficial Ownership

## This branch

This branch shall contain only codes for sample use.

Files are prepared using "dirty" approach. That is, input
data is never stored to database. The only thing that
matters here is to return the desired mock data as
JSON literals.

If one need to test application that needs to be tested
with JSON literals, use this branch.
