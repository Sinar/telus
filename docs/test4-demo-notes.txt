Running 'test4.py' has two variations.

1. For entire data, use line 78.
   See result in 'test4-demo-1.{log,png}' files.

        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table4") # entire data
        #cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table4 WHERE name = ?",
        #    ('Thomas Edison',)) # filter data by target name
        # note that this ^^^^^ last comma is needed, else syntax error

2. For filter data, use line 79-80.
   See result in 'test4-demo-2.{log,png}' files.

        #cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table4") # entire data
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table4 WHERE name = ?",
            ('Thomas Edison',)) # filter data by target name
        # note that this ^^^^^ last comma is needed, else syntax error
